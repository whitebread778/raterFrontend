## Rater Frontend

This is the frontend repo. To have the full app running, you will also need to download backend api from this repo title [link](https://github.com/johnnykungdev/rater_api)

## Why We Build Rater?

There are other review websites/platforms where students share their experience with post-secondary school or program. However, we couldn't find one specifically for BCIT student, and we wanted to build a safe space for any BCIT students to share their experience with BCIT's program anonymously. We believe that these honest reviews will help future students make critical education choices.  

## Features
- Search for BCIT program
- View program detail
- View and Post a review of selected program
